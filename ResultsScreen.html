        <br><h3>ERC Sweep Up In Derrylin</h3>
        <p>It was a case of smash and grab as ERC won nearly all the prizes on offer at Rock Runners' annual 5K/10K event. First in the 5K, we had Anthony Duffy continue good form as he secured 2nd Male in 21:24. As for the 10K, the everpresent Dave Slater secured 3rd Male on a hilly course in a excellent time of 39:18. As for the ladies, Annette Hughes was Second Lady in 52:18 and Denise Kavannagh Third in 55:20.</p>
